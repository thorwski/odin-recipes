        <p>This ricotta pie has a rich, sweet crust and mini chocolate chips in the filling. <br> My in-laws are Italian and they say that this is the best pie. It is always<br>requested for Christmas.</p>
        <p>This old-fashioned ricotta pie recipe is rich, creamy, and tastes just like it came from an Italian bakery.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ricotta Pie Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this absolutely irresistible ricotta pie recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Eggs:</b> This Italian ricotta pie calls for a whopping 16 eggs (12 for the filling and four for the crust).</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> You'll need three cups of white sugar (two for the filling and one for the crust).</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Vanilla:</b> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the ricotta filling and the sweet crust.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Ricotta:</b> The dense, creamy filling calls for three pounds of ricotta cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Chocolate:</b> Semisweet chocolate chips take the decadent filling up a notch, but you can leave them out if you like.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Flour:</b> The sweet crust starts with four cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Baking powder:</b> Baking powder guarantees a tender and flaky pie crust.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Shortening:</b> Shortening (instead of butter) makes the pie crust easy to roll out and it holds its shape well.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Milk:</b> Brush the pie crust with milk to give it a matte finish.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>

            <br>
            <li><b>Bake the pies:</b> Bake the pies in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool on wire racks, then refrigerate.</li>

        <h4>Tips from recipe creator Misty:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of chocolate chips, you can use 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon zest.</li>
            <li>Instead of a lattice top, you can use cookie cutters and place the cutouts on the top of the pies.</li>
        </ul>
